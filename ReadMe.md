source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```env
# Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/service-account-key.json

# OpenAI API (if using OpenAI for text generation)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

3. **Create Service Account:**
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
   - Create a new service account
   - Download the JSON key file
   - Place it in a secure location and update the path in your `.env` file

### 6. Audio Setup

**Windows:**
- Ensure your microphone is properly configured
- Test microphone in Windows Settings > System > Sound

**macOS:**
- Grant microphone permissions to Terminal/your IDE
- Test microphone in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone

**Linux:**
- Install ALSA or PulseAudio if not already installed
- Test microphone with: `arecord -d 5 test.wav`
